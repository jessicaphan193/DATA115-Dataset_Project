## Motivation
Early this year I have left my boba job, but during my time there, my former co-workers and I would always think about the boba at other franchise; seeing if they'd be better or worse than where we working at. We all have been to various locations ourselves and wanted to decided what are the best boba locations in the PNW, specifically in the Portland area because of convenient.

## Data Source
There is no one specific source for all the various boba locations

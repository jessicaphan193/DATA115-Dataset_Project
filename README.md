## Boba in San Francisco, Californnia

## Motivation
Early this year I have left my boba job, but during my time there, my former co-workers and I would always think about the boba at other franchise; seeing if they'd be better or worse than where we working at. We all have been to various locations ourselves and wanted to decided what are the best boba locations. I was told California is the best place to look at due to the many varieties and rising number of boba franchise.


## Data Source
The data I used was from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vnxiclaire/bobabayarea). 

## Processing Steps
Due to the immense amount of boba locations in San Francisco, the original data has over 600 locations listed, even after clearing out dupilcate franchises, it dropped down to around 437 locations. At one point, I cut it down to the first 100, and then to the first 50 locations. However in the end, I decided to cut it down to the first 25 locations in order to read the data a lot easier. 

Within the .csv file, I deleted the address, lat, and long columns since they were unnecessary data.

## Analysis
While going through the data, one of the information crossed my mind was the popularity of the location.

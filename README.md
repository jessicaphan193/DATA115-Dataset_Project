## Boba in San Francisco, Californnia

## Motivation
Early this year I have left my boba job, but during my time there, my former co-workers and I would always think about the boba at other franchise; seeing if they'd be better or worse than where we working at. We all have been to various locations ourselves and wanted to decided what are the best boba locations. I was told California is the best place to look at due to the many varieties and rising number of boba franchise.

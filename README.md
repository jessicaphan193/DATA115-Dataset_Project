## Boba in San Francisco, Californnia

## Motivation
Early this year I have left my boba job, but during my time there, my former co-workers and I would always think about the boba at other franchise; seeing if they'd be better or worse than where we working at. We all have been to various locations ourselves and wanted to decided what are the best boba locations. I decided to focus in California particularly due to many of the boba locations are located in California.
